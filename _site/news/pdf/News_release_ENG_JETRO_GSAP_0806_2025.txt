Kailas Robotics Inc. Selected for JETRO “GSAP Manufacturing Tech Course” — Aiming to Enter the U.S. Manufacturing Industry

~ Taking on the Global Market with “MobiRobo,” a Mobile Manipulator Pioneering the Era of Physical AI ~

Kailas Robotics Inc. (Headquarters: Kawaguchi City, Saitama, Japan; CEO: Yoshihisa Shiomi) is pleased to announce its selection for the 
“Manufacturing Tech & HardTech Course” of the Global Startup Acceleration Program (GSAP) 2025, hosted by JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization).

Challenging the U.S. Market with Innovative Mobile Manipulator Technology  
Kailas Robotics is an innovative robotics company developing and manufacturing “MobiRobo,” a 
mobile manipulator equipped with industry-first technology that enables it to grasp objects while in motion. 
Our six-axis robot arm supports high-speed data integration with AI frameworks. Despite its ultra-compact and lightweight design, 
it offers precise operation and can be mounted on drones, AMRs, and humanoid robots, making it a groundbreaking product for various mobile platforms.

Partnering with a World-Class Acceleration Program  
The GSAP Manufacturing Tech Course, for which we have been selected, is run in collaboration with “industry 4.0,” 
an accelerator based in Illinois, USA. This approximately 12-week program leverages strong connections with major 
manufacturers and investors. Participating companies receive lectures on strategy, marketing, and fundraising, along with one-on-one mentoring, 
networking, and investor demo days—all aimed at making a strong entry into the U.S. manufacturing market.

World-Class Technology with International Recognition  
Kailas Robotics has already earned several international accolades:  
- CES 2025 Innovation Award: Officially recognized for our innovative technology at the world’s largest technology trade show  
- Global Pitch Battle Robotics Division Winner: Ranked first among five companies at the CES 2025 Japan Pavilion  
- Application Development Collaboration with MinebeaMitsumi: Technology co-development with a Nikkei Stock Average constituent company  
- Murata Manufacturing Co-Creation Project Excellence Award: Winner at KUMIHIMO Tech Camp with Murata 2024

Aiming to Contribute to the Next Generation of Manufacturing  
CEO Yoshihisa Shiomi commented, “Our selection for the GSAP Manufacturing Tech Course is a significant first 
step toward spreading our innovative mobile manipulator technology worldwide. By collaborating with mentors with 
decades of experience in the U.S. manufacturing industry, we aim to help solve the challenges of labor shortages and improved 
safety in manufacturing.”

Through advanced System on Chip (SoC) designs and FPGA technology, we continue to develop 
innovative robotic arms capable of achieving precision operations while in motion—something previously thought impossible. 
Kailas Robotics will continue to support the transformation of the manufacturing industry in the Industry 4.0 era and work toward a 
society that enhances human potential and safety.
