October 23, 2024

Kailas Robotics Inc. (Kailas Robotics: Kawaguchi City, Saitama Prefecture) has been selected for the "CIC 2024 J-StarX Boston Robotics 
Program" led by JETRO.

The program aims to enhance practical knowledge and skills necessary for international expansion, 
including to the U.S., while also formulating strategies for global growth and building 
relationships within the local community in the Boston/Cambridge area. In preparation for travel,
 participants will first acquire foundational knowledge for overseas expansion in Japan. On-site, 
 they will refine practical skills such as pitching and prepare for global expansion by establishing 
 relationships with the local community and stakeholders.

   effective Q&A, and confident presentations.

CEO Dambadarjaa Munkhbayar expressed,  
"We are honored to be selected for this top-level program worldwide. For our company, which develops innovative 
robotic arms, being chosen for the CIC '2024 J-StarX Boston Robotics Program' will accelerate our demonstration 
experiments and market development in the U.S. Our robotic arms for mobile platforms are capable of grasping 
objects while in motion and are characterized by their lightweight design and high-speed, precise movements. 
Considering the global trend of declining labor forces, we believe this technology will become essential 
in the future. We are also developing prosthetic devices to support individuals with upper limb disabilities. 
In developing these lightweight, high-performance arms, we aim to collaborate with various companies and 
industries worldwide to create products that can compete globally."
