        Kailas Robotics (Headquarters: Nishi-Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture) 
        will make its debut at the world’s largest digital technology trade show, 
        "CES 2025," held in Las Vegas, USA, from January 9 to January 12, 2025. 
        The company will exhibit in the startup-exclusive area (Eureka Park) 
        within the Japan Pavilion.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        During this exhibition, Kailas Robotics will showcase a 
        demonstration that combines its patented technology, 
        "robotic arm for mobile platforms," with XR goggles 
        equipped with eye-tracking technology, allowing the 
        robotic arm to automatically capture objects that the 
        user gazes at. This innovative technology, applicable not 
        only to drones and UGVs but also to humanoids and prosthetics, 
        will be featured at the world's largest tech show.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        Kailas Robotics aims to leverage global feedback 
        from this exhibition for solution development geared towards 
        implementing science and technology and expanding its reach to end users.

        - Exhibition Overview<br>
        1. "MobiRobo" - A Robotic Arm that Captures Target Objects with Eye-Tracking<br>
        Traditional robotic arms are designed with the assumption that the 
        pivot point at the base is fixed, making it impossible for them to grasp 
        objects while moving, unlike humans. "MobiRobo" breaks this convention by 
        accurately capturing target objects even when the arm's pivot point is mobile. 
        Initially developed for drone integration, this lightweight, high-performance 
        robotic arm can be used in tasks such as high-altitude work, external wall 
        inspections, exterior cleaning, remote sample collection, and hands-free delivery services.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        The demonstration at CES envisions the use of this arm as an assistive device 
        for individuals with upper limb disabilities, as a third hand for tasks such as 
        soldering, or as a component of humanoid robots.
