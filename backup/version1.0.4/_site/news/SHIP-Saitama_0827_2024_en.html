        Kailas Robotics Co., Ltd. (Kailas Robotics, Kawaguchi City, Saitama Prefecture) has been selected for the "Saitama Hands-on Innovation Program for Funding (abbreviated as Ship for Funding)," a hands-on support program for manufacturing companies operated by Saitama Prefecture.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        In Saitama Prefecture, as outlined in the "Saitama Industrial Vitality & Employment Strategy" (FY 2022–FY 2026), it is anticipated that the population will continue to decline, with the proportion of elderly citizens over 75 years old expected to exceed 30% in the near future, and the working-age population is also projected to decrease. To support the lives of residents, including the elderly, it is necessary to create new services utilizing advanced technologies. 
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        Saitama Prefecture is home to many small and medium-sized manufacturing companies that are constantly developing new products and services. However, the development of new products and services often requires significant funding. Moreover, even after a company successfully develops a new product or service, funding is essential for its implementation in society. In cases where large amounts of funding are needed, raising capital from venture capitalists may also be necessary. Through this support program, Saitama Prefecture aims to assist manufacturing companies within the prefecture in securing the necessary funding.

    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        Key Program Support:
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        - Hands-on Support Program:<br>
        Starting in late August, selected manufacturing companies will receive hands-on support. Venture capitalists and consultants will be dispatched by the program office to help these companies address challenges and formulate growth strategies for fundraising.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        - Collaboration with Financial Support Networks:<br>
        The program will collaborate with a financial support network comprising financial institutions, support organizations within Saitama Prefecture, and cooperative venture capitalists to assist manufacturing companies in securing funding.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        - Results Reporting Meeting:<br>
        In March, a results presentation will be held for the manufacturing companies selected for the hands-on support program, showcasing their efforts and fundraising examples.
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        Dambadarjaa Munkhbayar, CEO of Kailas Robotics, stated:<br>
        "As a hardware startup, being selected for Saitama Prefecture’s 'Ship for Funding' will greatly accelerate our business development. We are deeply grateful to Saitama Prefecture for this opportunity. Our mobile robotic arm, currently under development, can grip objects while in motion and is characterized by its lightweight, high-speed, and precise operations. Considering the global decline in the labor force, we believe this technology will become increasingly important. Through this program, we aim to collaborate with various companies and sectors within the prefecture to develop products that can compete globally."
