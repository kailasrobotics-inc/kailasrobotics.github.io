        Kailas Robotics CEO, Munkhbayar Dambadarjaa, commented:<br/>  
        "First, I would like to express our gratitude to Aichi Prefecture 
        for selecting us. As a hardware startup focused on manufacturing, being 
        chosen for the 'AICHI Manufacturing Acceleration Program' will significantly 
        accelerate our business expansion. Our robotic arm for mobile platforms 
        can grip objects while in motion, featuring lightweight, high-speed, and 
        precise operation. Considering the global decline in the working population, 
        this technology will become essential in the future. We are also developing a 
        prosthetic device for people with upper limb disabilities. We aim to create 
        world-class products through collaborations with various companies and 
        sectors in the prefecture during the development of this unprecedented 
        lightweight and high-performance arm."
