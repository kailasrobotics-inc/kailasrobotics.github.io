            Kailas Robotics is excited to announce its inaugural exhibition at <br>
            the world's largest drone trade show, "AUVSI XPONENTIAL."

        Kailas Robotics, based in Kawaguchi City, Saitama Prefecture, with CEO Dambadarjaa Munkhbayar at the
        helm, will be showcasing at the event from April 22 to April 25 in San Diego, USA.

        **Kailas Robotics' Debut at the World's Largest UAV Trade Show "AUVSI XPONENTIAL 2024"**
        "AUVSI XPONENTIAL" is an annual unmanned aircraft systems exhibition where more than 500 companies
        from over 50 countries gather, attracting over 8,000 industry professionals. The event features
        cutting-edge companies not only in drones but also in robotics, artificial intelligence, and autonomous
        driving technologies. This year, the event will take place at the San Diego Convention Center from April 22
        to 25.

    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        At this premier exhibition, Kailas Robotics will showcase its small, lightweight, and high-performance
        robotic arms designed for drone integration, along with a versatile robotic arm-equipped UGV
        (Unmanned Ground Vehicle). The collaborative potential between humans and robots is becoming
        increasingly vital due to the declining labor force and rising labor costs in advanced countries, and the
        need to avoid dangerous areas for work. The robotic arms developed by Kailas Robotics can grasp targets
        while moving in all directions, enabling applications previously impossible with large and heavy bases,
        such as drone integration and deployment in confined operational sites.

    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        In anticipation of the exhibition, CEO Dambadarjaa ("Damba") stated:
        "At our booth, we plan to perform a demonstration where the arm, mounted on a rig simulating a drone
        in flight, will grab a ball placed in the designated target space while in motion. The control will be accessible from smartphones and tablets such as iPads, where users can indicate targets on the iPad screen, and
        the arm will automatically capture those targets. We warmly invite everyone to visit our booth at the
        venue."

    <div style="margin: 3%;">
        This announcement underlines Kailas Robotics' commitment to advancing robotic technology and its
        applications in various industries, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with robotic integration.

        About Kailas Robotics Inc.<br>
        Kailas Robotics' robotic arms are developed based on cutting-edge SoC (System on Chip) and designed
        from FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), achieving miniaturization. The core technology involves a
        gripping technique that ensures the arm can securely grasp objects even when the pivot moves. The
        company develops innovative arms essential for various robots, optimizing control systems and actuators
        for drones, UGVs, humanoids, and prosthetic hands.
