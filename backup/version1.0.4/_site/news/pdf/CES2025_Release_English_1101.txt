"Kailas Robotics to Exhibit at CES 2025 Japan Pavilion"

Kailas Robotics (Headquarters: Nishi-Kawaguchi, Saitama Prefecture) will make its debut at the world’s largest digital technology trade show, "CES 2025," held in Las Vegas, USA, from January 9 to January 12, 2025. The company will exhibit in the startup-exclusive area (Eureka Park) within the Japan Pavilion.

During this exhibition, Kailas Robotics will showcase a demonstration that combines its patented technology, "robotic arm for mobile platforms," with XR goggles equipped with eye-tracking technology, allowing the robotic arm to automatically capture objects that the user gazes at. This innovative technology, applicable not only to drones and UGVs but also to humanoids and prosthetics, will be featured at the world's largest tech show.

Kailas Robotics aims to leverage global feedback from this exhibition for solution development geared towards implementing science and technology and expanding its reach to end users.

- Exhibition Overview
1. "MobiRobo" - A Robotic Arm that Captures Target Objects with Eye-Tracking
Traditional robotic arms are designed with the assumption that the pivot point at the base is fixed, making it impossible for them to grasp objects while moving, unlike humans. "MobiRobo" breaks this convention by accurately capturing target objects even when the arm's pivot point is mobile. Initially developed for drone integration, this lightweight, high-performance robotic arm can be used in tasks such as high-altitude work, external wall inspections, exterior cleaning, remote sample collection, and hands-free delivery services.

The demonstration at CES envisions the use of this arm as an assistive device for individuals with upper limb disabilities, as a third hand for tasks such as soldering, or as a component of humanoid robots.
