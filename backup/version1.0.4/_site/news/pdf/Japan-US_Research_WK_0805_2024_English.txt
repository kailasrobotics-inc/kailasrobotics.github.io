Kailas Robotics’ CSO Yoshi Shiomi Speaks at Japan-US Research Collaboration Week 2024 at Stanford University and Japan Innovation Campus

August 5, 2024

Yoshi Shiomi, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) of Kailas Robotics Co., Ltd. (Kailas Robotics, Kawaguchi City, Saitama Prefecture), delivered a presentation at the Japan-US Research Collaboration Week 2024, held at Stanford University in California and Japan Innovation Campus (JIC).

The Japan-US Research Collaboration Week, organized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), aims to establish a dynamic platform for universities, research institutes, businesses, and financial institutions from Japan and the US to cooperate on joint research projects. Through this initiative, the program seeks to enhance Japan-US science and technology diplomacy, facilitate the social implementation of research outcomes in business, and foster human-centered, sustainable, healthy, and equitable societal development alongside economic growth.

The event invites various stakeholders engaged in ongoing collaborations or seeking to establish new partnerships to join discussions on developing and nurturing collaborations. Together, participants explore strategies for identifying potential collaborators and learn from the experiences of existing collaborative initiatives. This forum provides insights into the evolving "research highway" designed to accelerate research collaboration between Japan and the US and to facilitate the translation of research outcomes into social implementation and commercialization.

Shiomi, the CSO who participated, stated:
"First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to JST, Stanford School of Medicine, JETRO, and JIC for providing us with this opportunity. Not only was I able to present our technology, but I also engaged in meaningful discussions with various startups and researchers, including those in biotechnology, making it a highly valuable experience."
